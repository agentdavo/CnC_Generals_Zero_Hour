
# Command & Conquer Generals (inc. Zero Hour) Source Code

This repository includes source code for Command & Conquer Generals, and its expansion pack Zero Hour. This release provides support to the Steam Workshop for both games ([C&C Generals](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse/?appid=2229870) and [C&C Generals - Zero Hour](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse/?appid=2732960)).


## Dependencies

If you wish to rebuild the source code and tools successfully you will need to find or write new replacements (or remove the code using them entirely) for the following libraries;

- DirectX SDK (Version 9.0 or higher) (expected path `\Code\Libraries\DirectX\`)
- STLport (4.5.3) - patched version tracked in `lib/STLport`
- 3DSMax 4 SDK - (expected path `\Code\Libraries\Max4SDK\`)
- NVASM - (expected path `\Code\Tools\NVASM\`)
- BYTEmark - (expected path `\Code\Libraries\Source\Benchmark`)
- RAD Miles Sound System SDK - (expected path `\Code\Libraries\Source\WWVegas\Miles6\`)
- RAD Bink SDK - (expected path `\Code\GameEngineDevice\Include\VideoDevice\Bink`)
- SafeDisk API - (expected path `\Code\GameEngine\Include\Common\SafeDisk` and `\Code\Tools\Launcher\SafeDisk\`)
- Miles Sound System "Asimp3" - (expected path `\Code\Libraries\WPAudio\Asimp3`)
- UniSpySDK - open source replacement for GameSpy (tracked in `lib/UniSpySDK`)
- ZLib (1.1.4) - (expected path `\Code\Libraries\Source\Compression\ZLib\`)
- LZH-Light (1.0) - (expected path `\Code\Libraries\Source\Compression\LZHCompress\CompLibSource` and `CompLibHeader`)

## Directory Layout

Source code now resides in `src/`, public headers in `include/`, and libraries in `lib/`. The legacy tree under `Generals/Code` will be migrated here over time.

External libraries such as LVGL, miniaudio, uGLES, UniSpySDK, zlib and liblzhl are provided under `lib/`. Most of them are git submodules. After cloning this repository run:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
to fetch the submodule sources. LVGL (version 9.3) is included directly in the repository to allow local modifications.

CMake builds these third party libraries via `lib/CMakeLists.txt`.

 

## Compiling (Win32 Only)

To use the compiled binaries, you must own the game. The C&C Ultimate Collection is available for purchase on [EA App](https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/command-and-conquer/command-and-conquer-the-ultimate-collection/buy/pc) or [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/39394/Command__Conquer_The_Ultimate_Collection/).

The quickest way to build all configurations in the project is to open `rts.dsw` in Microsoft Visual Studio C++ 6.0 (SP6 recommended for binary matching to Generals patch 1.08 and Zero Hour patch 1.04) and select Build -> Batch Build, then hit the “Rebuild All” button.

If you wish to compile the code under a modern version of Microsoft Visual Studio, you can convert the legacy project file to a modern MSVC solution by opening `rts.dsw` in Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003, and then opening the newly created project and solution file in MSVC 2015 or newer.

## CMake Build (Experimental)
You can try building a minimal stub using CMake:
```
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
```
This will compile a placeholder executable while migration is in progress.

On **macOS** you must use the Apple Clang compiler (usually `/usr/bin/clang`).
Using GCC will fail because the audio backend requires Clang's `-fblocks`
extension when compiling against CoreAudio headers.

NOTE: As modern versions of MSVC enforce newer revisions of the C++ standard, you will need to make extensive changes to the codebase before it successfully compiles, even more so if you plan on compiling for the Win64 platform.

When the workspace has finished building, the compiled binaries will be copied to the folder called `/Run/` found in the root of each games directory. 
 


## Known Issues

Windows has a policy where executables that contain words “version”, “update” or “install” in their filename will require UAC Elevation to run. This will affect “versionUpdate” and “buildVersionUpdate” projects from running as post-build events. Renaming the output binary name for these projects to not include these words should resolve the issue for you.


## STLport
The repository includes STLport 4.5.3 under `lib/STLport` with the patch from
`stlport.diff` already applied. The diff is kept for reference should you need
to verify the changes against an original copy of the library.
